LAYOUT OF THE B-TREE ON THE FILE
***********************************
The random access file to which the B-Tree is written
stores the root location pointer, degree of the tree,
height of the tree, and length of the sequence in the
first four 4-byte positions of the file:

First 4 bytes (int):		root location pointer
Second 4 bytes (int):		height of the tree
Third 4 bytes (int):		degree of the tree
Fourth 4 bytes (int):		length of sequence to search


Each BTreeNode stores up to [(2 * degree) - 1] number
of TreeObjects. A BTreeNode contains a boolean to
indicate whether the node is a leaf node, a location
pointer, the number of keys, and array of pointers
for the children nodes, and an array of the 
TreeObjects contained in the node.

First 4 bytes (int):	location pointer
Next 1 bytes (boolean):	leaf
Next 4 bytes (int):		number of objects
Next 4 bytes (int):     first child pointer
Next 8 bytes (long):    first object key
Next 4 bytes (int):     first object frequency
Next 4 bytes (int):     second child pointer
...
Next 8 bytes (long):    last object key
Next 4 bytes (int):     last object frequency
Next 4 bytes (int):     last child pointer

RELEVANT OBSERVATIONS

 --- I believe that observations around the use of
 the cache are supposed to go here ---
